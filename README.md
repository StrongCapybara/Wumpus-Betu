# 🐗 Wumpus-Betu

**Wumpus-Betu** is a playful and customized fork of the classic **Wumpus World Simulator**. Originally designed to demonstrate logical agent behavior in a grid-based world, this version swaps the main character with photos of my dear friend "Betu" — adding a humiliating (for him) and personal twist to the original concept.

> 🧠 Based on the famous AI problem from Russell & Norvig’s *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*.
