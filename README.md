# Wumpus Betu

A Wumpus World Simulator developed in Javascript, HTML and CSS with my friend's photos as the main player.
Forked from [Wumpus World Simulator](https://github.com/thiagodnf/wumpus-world-simulator/releases/latest)

## Betu?
I have a very dear friend and everyone in our group calls him "Betu" out of love. I replaced the character's image with photos of him and hence the name "Wumpus-Betu".

## How to play
