# Wumpus Betu

A Wumpus World Simulator developed in Javascript, HTML and CSS with my friend's photos as the main player.
Forked from [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/thiagodnf/wumpus-world-simulator.svg)](https://github.com/thiagodnf/wumpus-world-simulator/releases/latest)

## Betu?
I have a very dear friend and everyone in our group calls him "Betu" out of love. I replaced the character's image with photos of him and hence the name "Wumpus-Betu".

## Wumpus?
Hunt the Wumpus is an early computer game, based on a simple hide and seek format featuring a mysterious monster (the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms. It was originally a text-based game written in BASIC. It has since been ported to various programming languages and platforms including graphical versions.
